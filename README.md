# InStep

A resource to help runners find music that matches their pace.

## Getting Started

I still need to polish quite a few pieces of this project, but feel free to fork and or clone.

### Prerequisites

All dependencies are listed in my package.json file, so a simple install command will suffice:

```
npm i 
```
or
```
yarn add 
```

### Installing

I use nodemon to keep my server running, and have it only pay attention to files in the server folder so it wouldn't restart every time I changed my front end:

```
nodemon --watch server
```
Then, start up the front end:

```
npm start
```
